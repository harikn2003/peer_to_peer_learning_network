# Offline Peer-to-Peer Learning Network for Rural Schools
Abstract:-
In rural or low-connectivity regions, students often lack consistent internet access for learning resources. This project aims to develop a hybrid Flutter-based solution that allows teachers to share study materials and quizzes offline with students using Wi-Fi Direct or Nearby Connections.
The system includes a Mobile app (for teachers to upload content), a mobile app for students to receive and view shared content, and a quiz mode for assessmentsâ€”all done without the internet, making learning more accessible in remote settings.

Objectives:-

- Enable offline content sharing via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct.
- Allow teachers to preload quizzes that students can take offline.
- Ensure low-resource usage, ideal for rural schools.

Content Sharing Flow

1. Teacher uploads notes/quizzes via web or mobile.
2. Teacher starts a local sharing session.
3. Student opens the app in receive mode.
4. Notes and quizzes are sent over Wi-Fi Direct or Nearby Connections.
5. Student receives and stores content locally.
6. Student browses notes or attempts the quiz offline.
